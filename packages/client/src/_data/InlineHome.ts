I am also a recipient of the <strong>Renaissance Engineering Scholarship</strong>.",
    'My interests lie in fullstack software engineering and language compilers. I have about 2 years of combined internship experience working on various software stacks. In order to deepen my knowledge in programming languages, I have developed an interest in language compilers, exploring various compiler phases and optimization techniques.',
